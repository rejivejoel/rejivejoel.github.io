# CPSC 120L Portfolio

## Introduction:

**Hey there! My name is Joel Rejive and I am currently a freshman at California State University, Fullerton pursuing a career in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity and I plan on graduating in 2029! Before college I have always had a passion for computers and I started coding small projects from a young age. When I entered high school I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do until my junior year of high school where I took a cybersecurity program and decided that was what I wanted to do as a career.**
