## <span style="color: red;">Introduction:</span>


**Hey there! My name is Joel Rejive and I am currently a freshman at California State University, Fullerton pursuing a career in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity and I plan on graduating in 2029! Before college I have always had a passion for computers and I started coding small projects from a young age. When I entered high school I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do until my junior year of high school where I took a cybersecurity program and decided that was what I wanted to do as a career.**

## Favorite Projects:

```diff
+ Lab 1 - Part 1
```
* This was probably one of my favorite labs because while we didn't do much for the actual lab we got a basic understanding on how github works and how to pull/commit changes we make in our code to github. This in my opinion is a very important skill and is something I see myself in the future doing. Prior to this lab I wasn't really sure on how to use github but this lab really helped me a lot.
