## Introduction:

**Hey there! My name is Joel Rejive and I am currently a freshman at California State University, Fullerton pursuing a career in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity and I plan on graduating in 2029! Before college I have always had a passion for computers and I started coding small projects from a young age. When I entered high school I knew I wanted to be a computer scientist but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do until my junior year of high school where I took a cybersecurity program and decided that was what I wanted to do as a career.**

## Favorite Projects:

```diff
+ Lab 1 - Part 1
```
* This was probably one of my favorite labs because while we didn't do much for the actual lab we got a basic understanding on how github works and how to pull/commit changes we make in our code to github. This in my opinion is a very important skill and is something I see myself in the future doing. Prior to this lab I wasn't really sure on how to use github but this lab really helped me a lot.

```diff
+ Lab 3 - Part 1
```

* This was another of my favorite labs that I did throughout the semester. I loved this lab because we took given inputs and applied an equation to it to find our the BMR of a person. This was very exciting because we could enter in certain values and it would run it back through a pre-existing equation and give us the BMR of that person. I believe this lab was useful because it helped us think critically while we were coding.


```diff
+ Lab 6 - Part 1
```

* From the entire semester I would say this was my favorite lab activity. Though this lab was pretty simple it was cool to see how we could insert custom variables into a sentence. For example when we were making our sandwich we could choose what kind of bread and meat and condiment we wanted. Once we did that it would produce a sentence containing the condiments that we provided. This was really cool because regardless of what value you put into it, it would be its own unique sentence.
